### Getting Started
1. Clone the git URL in any folder on the system: 
    a. Right click on the desired folder and select "Git Bash Here". 
    b. Paste the below command in the terminal which gets opened: 
    git clone https://github.com/aksharabhat/aksharaBhat-fed-test.git
2. In the same terminal go to the directory created: "cd aksharaBhat-fed-test"
3. Checkout to master branch(If not present in master branch) as the code stays in master branch: "git checkout master"
4. Install all dependencies: "npm install"
5. Run the command to start the server: "npm start"
6. If any of the modules were not installed correctly during npm install, there is chances that error might pop up after npm start. Please install those modules manually to make the react code work.
